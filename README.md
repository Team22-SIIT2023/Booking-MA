### Structure
TravelBee consist of 5 classes that we took this semester:
-   Software Frontend Engenieering
-   Software Backend Engenieering
-   Mobile Application Engenieering
-   Software Tests Engenieering
-   Software development methodologies


#### Backend
We developed backend for this app in Java Spring Boot framework. There are 3 different roles in the system: admin, host and guest. Users can register as guests and hosts. For authentication and authorization we used JWT. The database we used for this project - PostgreSQL.


#### Mobile app
We developed our mobile app as a native Android app.  Connect your mobile phone using a USB cable or Wi-Fi, run the app and it will get installed on your phone. You use it with the backend. You need to be connected to the same network on both devices and in local.properties put the IP address of the network. If you want to use notifications make sure you allowed them in your settings.
